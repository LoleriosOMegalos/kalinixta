<p>Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an action role-playing video game developed by Ubisoft Quebec and published by Ubisoft. It is the eleventh major installment, and 21st overall, in the Assassin's Creed series and the successor to 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins. Set in the years 431–422 BC, the plot tells a mythological history of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. Players control a male or female mercenary who fights on both sides of the conflict as they attempt to find their family.</p>

<p>Assassin's Creed Odyssey was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on October 5, 2018, with a Stadia version launching alongside the service in 2019. It received praise for its gameplay, graphics, story, characters, and world design, while being criticised for feeling too ambitious. The game was followed by Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which takes place in medieval Britain and Norway during the Viking expansion across Europe.</p>
